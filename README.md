# -Divisibility-criteria-2-n-d-k-
Program that calculates the divisibility criteria of a problem where: having the form 2^n - 1 = d*k, where d is an element belonging to the set of odd numbers, n is a number belonging to the set of natural numbers. n is a number that changes according to the value of d as 2^n-1 must have within its decomposition the number d and k will be the remaining numbers of the decomposition.
